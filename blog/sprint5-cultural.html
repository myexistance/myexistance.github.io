                    <h4><u>What are three new things you
                    have learned about yourself and
                    your ego as a result of the core
                    learning?</u></h4>


                    <ol>
                              <li>
                                        Procrastinating. I seem to be always looking for the short cut and find a solution, CTL+C and CTL+V, rather than find myself actually programming.
                              </li>
                              <br>
                              <li>
                                        Ironically, I was trying to work on the inner peace rather than programming, and the confidence, trying to find a point where I can actually code. But I was always worried about the technical side.
                              </li>
                              <br>
                              <li>
                                        I found me trying to calm my self so that I can actually accelerate on working. I
                                        
                              </li>
                    </ol>

                    <h4><u>What are the role of values,
                    empathy and self awareness in
                    learning and programming?</u></h4>
                    
                    <p class="uppercase">
                    Probaly, it is most imperative to know where you are at. Self-awareness keeps you at a point where you search for the solution and it would proabably the narrow down the ways to get to the solution. Yet, the empathy, staying in the mood, knowing what the problem may keep you from not deviating from the track. 
                    </p>

                    <h4><u>What has surprised you the most
                    about the core learning?</u></h4>

                    <p class="uppercase">
                    Being able to push myself further with the habit of solving a problem.        
                    </p>

                    <h4><u>What were the most challenging
                    aspects of the core learning?</u></h4>
                    <p class="uppercase">
                    Knowing that it is not really a part of programing?  
                    </p>


                    <h4><u>Why do you think we, a
                    programming school, are spending
                    so much time focusing on core
                    learning in a web development
                    bootcamp course?</u></h4>

                    <p class="uppercase">
                    To keep ourselves to be familiar with the situations while working in teams and co-work. And empower us to solve the problems we may face in the future.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h4><u>Does the time you spent studying
                    core learning here feel like a
                    waste of time? Should you have
                    just used that time to
                    practising programming instead?
                    Justify your answer.</u></h4>
                    <p class="uppercase">
                              I don't think it was a waste of
                              time, to be honest, I did not enjoy it more than the programming itself but I sort sensed that it is still an important part of learning. Still I doubt that core learning, which is just a mind control, staying in the habbit will get us the the jobs in the industry. So I would ask, what if the <strong>CORE</strong> learning waas covered before/after the course rather than doing every week.
