                    <h4><u>Difference between the HTML and the CSS</u></h4>

                    <p class="uppercase">
                              An analogy to describe the differences between HTML and CSS - <strong>HTML lets you create the structure of a website. CSS lets you make the website look nice. JavaScript lets you change
                              HTML and CSS. Because it lets you change HTML and CSS, it can do tons of things.</strong>
                    </p>

                    <h4><u>Control Flow and the loops</u></h4>
                    <p class="uppercase">
                              Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life, for example 'waking up' or 'brushing your
                              teeth' - <strong>The control flow is the order in which the computer executes statements in a script. Code is run in order from the first
                              line in the file to the last line, unless the computer runs across the (extremely frequent) structures that change the
                              control flow, such as conditionals and loops.</stong><br>
                              <p class="indent">
                                        if (teeth==clean) {<br>
                                        brushteeth();<br>
                                        } else {<br>
                                        skip();<br>
                                        }
                              </p>
                    </p>

                    <h4><u>DOM</u></h4>
                    <p class="uppercase">
                              Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with it. - <strong>The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for HTML and XML documents. It represents the page so that
                              programs can change the document structure, style, and content. The DOM represents the document as nodes and objects.
                              That way, programming languages can connect to the page.
                              
                              A Web page is a document. This document can be either displayed in the browser window or as the HTML source. But it is
                              the same document in both cases. The Document Object Model (DOM) represents that same document so it can be manipulated.
                              The DOM is an object-oriented representation of the web page, which can be modified with a scripting language such as
                              JavaScript.</strong>
                    </p>      
                    
                    <h4><u>Arrays and Object</u></h4>
                    <p class="uppercase">
                              Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.
                              <p>When to Use Objects
                              Objects are used to represent a “thing” in your code. That could be a person, a car, a building, a book, a character in
                              a game — basically anything that is made up or can be defined by a set of characteristics. In objects, these
                              characteristics are called properties that consist of a key and a value.
                    </p>
                    <p class="uppercase"><strong>When to Use Arrays</strong>
                    We use arrays whenever we want to create and store a list of multiple items in a single variable. Arrays are especially
                    useful when creating ordered collections where items in the collection can be accessed by their numerical position in
                    the list. Just as object properties can store values of any primitive data type (as well as an array or another object),
                    so too can arrays consist of strings, numbers, booleans, objects, or even other arrays.
                    </p>
                    </p>
                    <h4><u>Functions</u></h4>
                    <p class="uppercase">
                              Explain what functions are and why they are useful.<strong>Functions are "self contained" modules of code that accomplish a specific task. Functions usually "take in" data,
                              process it, and "return" a result. Once a function is written, it can be used over and over and over again. Functions
                              can be "called" from the inside of other functions.</strong>
                    
                    </p>
