      <h2>Learning Plan</h2>
      <br>
      <h3>What is my long term goal and/or career pathway?</h3>
      <p>I'd like to work as a React Developer if I could,since I always coded and made few projects with React where I could and perhaps it is the most front-end libraries that I am most familiar with. I would like to take my opportunities at the EDA to practice my Javascript foundation skills and get in the habit of spending time to make more experices to develope my skills in the industry.</p>

      <h3>A description of my strengths and limitations in relation to learning:</h3>
      <p>I think I have many ideas that I like to try making but lack of skills and what would be the best UX design that everyone would love to use. Forthe meantime, I want to make connections with many people in the industry sharing ideas and possiblities in technology and learn to think more like a developer.</p>
      <p>Limitations-wise, there are and always will be many obstackles that I will have to go through including my health issues and diabilities but I think that it imperative not to give up and contribute in the indusrty and move towards the ideal, and the perfectionism acquiring 1 percent at a time.</p>

      <h3>Skills (non-technical - human skills) I'd like to see developed in myself while at EDA:</h3>
      <p>Conflict management and better communication with  not only myself but with others.</p>

      <h3>An explanation of how I will manage myself to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators
        and industry/community representatives:</h3>
      <p>Conribute more time and effort to participate in every aspects.</p>

      <p>better time management and ability to seek for help when I get stuck in times of when I really get stuck.</p>
      
      <h3>What I will do when things are building up and starting to get to me:</h3>
      <p>I will have to deal with the anxiety and frustrations but I am sure that everyone else just starting a new course would feel the same?</p>

      
      <h3>How and where I will seek help in a timely way:</h3>
      <p>If I can't find the answer myself by googling, I'll seek assistance from my peers, or facilitator (depending on
        context). </p>

      <h3>What I expect from the facilitation team</h3>
      <p>I think I am, a person who tries to find the cause of the problem and solve the very basic rather than just getting used to how to get the puzzle I am trying to solve which could maybe a disadvantage but I would like a better explaination and have a clear understanding of why this is that and so on. 😅 </p>

      <h3>Any time that needs to be blocked out for external commitments?</h3>
      <p>I don't really have any commitment ahead but  may have some hours or days away for my hospital visits for my regular diabetes check up.</p>
